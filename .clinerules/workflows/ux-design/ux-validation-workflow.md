# UX Validation Workflow

## Overview
This workflow validates UX designs against UrbanAI's design system, accessibility standards, and user experience best practices before implementation.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Design System Compliance
**Objective**: Ensure all designs follow established design system guidelines

**Tools Used**:
- Design System Validator MCP (token validation)
- Supernova MCP (design system sync)
- Sequential Thinking MCP (compliance analysis)

**Validation Checks**:
1. Color palette adherence (UrbanAI brand colors)
2. Typography consistency (font families, sizes, weights)
3. Spacing system compliance (8px grid system)
4. Component usage (approved component library)
5. Iconography standards (Lucide icon set)
6. Layout patterns (established grid systems)

### Step 2: Accessibility Validation
**Objective**: Ensure designs meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

**Tools Used**:
- Browser Tools MCP (accessibility audit)
- Design System Validator MCP (contrast checking)
- Mobile MCP (touch target validation)

**Validation Checks**:
1. Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. Focus indicators (visible and consistent)
3. Keyboard navigation (logical tab order)
4. Screen reader compatibility (proper ARIA labels)
5. Touch target sizes (44px minimum on mobile)
6. Alternative text for images and icons

### Step 3: Responsive Design Validation
**Objective**: Ensure designs work across all device sizes and orientations

**Tools Used**:
- Browser Tools MCP (responsive testing)
- Mobile MCP (device compatibility)
- Playwright MCP (cross-browser testing)

**Validation Checks**:
1. Breakpoint compliance (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
2. Content reflow and readability
3. Touch interactions on mobile devices
4. Orientation changes (portrait/landscape)
5. Content prioritization for small screens

### Step 4: User Experience Validation
**Objective**: Validate designs against user experience best practices

**Tools Used**:
- Sequential Thinking MCP (UX analysis)
- Firecrawl MCP (competitor analysis)
- Task Manager MCP (user feedback integration)

**Validation Checks**:
1. Information hierarchy and visual flow
2. Cognitive load assessment
3. Error prevention and handling
4. Progressive disclosure patterns
5. User flow efficiency
6. Emotional design elements
