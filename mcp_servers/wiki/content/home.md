# UrbanAI

## Overview

**UrbanAI** is a comprehensive backend platform and AI-agent service that empowers citizens, investors, and authorities to report, analyze, and resolve urban construction and environmental issues. The platform accepts geo-tagged photos and descriptions, automatically classifies potential code violations, crawls relevant local regulations, and‚Äîvia an interactive AI agent‚Äîguides users through any additional data collection. Finally, it generates and submits compliant reports or documents to the appropriate municipal channels and tracks each case through to resolution.

## Key Features

### üèóÔ∏è Issue Detection & Classification
- **Photo-based reporting**: Citizens can submit geo-tagged photos of construction irregularities, safety hazards, or environmental violations
- **AI-powered classification**: Automated analysis of images and descriptions to categorize issues
- **Smart prioritization**: Risk assessment and urgency classification based on safety impact

### üåç Location-Aware Regulation Compliance
- **Geo-location integration**: Automatic detection of jurisdiction and applicable local regulations
- **Regulatory database**: Web-crawled repository of municipal laws, building codes, and environmental standards
- **Compliance analysis**: AI-driven assessment of whether reported issues constitute actual violations

### ü§ñ Interactive AI Agent
- **Guided data collection**: Chat-based interface to gather additional information when needed
- **Expert consultation**: AI agent acts as both civil engineering and legal expert
- **Measurement guidance**: Interactive assistance for users to collect specific measurements or documentation

### üìã Automated Reporting & Tracking
- **Report generation**: Automated creation of compliant reports and documentation
- **Municipal integration**: Direct submission to appropriate authorities via online forms or prepared documents
- **Case tracking**: Status monitoring from submission through resolution
- **Follow-up management**: Automated reminders and status updates

## Project Architecture

UrbanAI is built using modern software engineering principles with a layered architecture approach:
