# UrbanAI Figma Project Structure

This document outlines the assumed organizational structure of the UrbanAI Figma project, based on common design system best practices. This structure aims to promote consistency, reusability, and efficient collaboration across design and development teams.

## 1. UrbanAI Design System File (`UrbanAI-Design-System`)

This is the central source of truth for all core design elements and components.

### Pages:

*   **Introduction/Overview:** Explains the purpose of the design system, how to use it, and key principles.
*   **Color Palette:** Defines all primary, secondary, accent, and semantic colors used across UrbanAI applications. Includes color names, HEX, RGB, and other relevant values.
*   **Typography:** Defines font families, sizes, weights, line heights, and text styles for various UI elements (headings, body text, captions, etc.).
*   **Iconography:** Contains a library of all approved icons, including their usage guidelines and variations.
*   **Components (Atomic/Molecule Level):**
    *   **Buttons:** All button states, sizes, and types.
    *   **Inputs:** Text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns.
    *   **Navigation Elements:** Tabs, menus, breadcrumbs.
    *   **Cards/Containers:** Reusable structural elements.
    *   *(and other foundational components)*
*   **Assets:** General assets like logos, illustrations, and imagery guidelines.
*   **Accessibility Guidelines:** Documentation on accessibility best practices applied to components and layouts.

## 2. Application-Specific Design Files

These files consume components from the `UrbanAI-Design-System` file and are used for designing specific application UIs.

### 2.1. Web Application Designs

*   **Pages:**
    *   **Login Page:** Wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and interaction flows for the web login experience.
    *   **Landing Page:** Wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and responsive layouts for the main web landing page.
    *   **Other Core Pages:** (e.g., Dashboard, Profile - *future scope*)

### 2.2. Android Application Designs

*   **Pages:**
    *   **Login Screen:** Wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and interaction flows for the Android login experience.
    *   **Landing Screen:** Wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and responsive layouts for the main Android landing screen.
    *   **Other Core Screens:** (e.g., Home, Settings - *future scope*)

## 3. Design Process & Collaboration

*   **Wireframes:** Initial low-fidelity layouts to define structure and flow.
*   **High-Fidelity Mockups:** Detailed visual designs incorporating the design system components and styles.
*   **Prototypes:** Interactive simulations of user flows.
*   **User Testing Feedback:** Documentation of insights from user testing sessions.
*   **Developer Handoff:** Guidelines and resources for developers to implement designs accurately.

This structure is a starting point. Please review and provide feedback on whether this accurately reflects or should be adapted to the actual organization of your Figma files.
