### IV. Week 4 - AI Tooling Evaluation and Coverage Optimization ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**AI Tooling Journey:**
- **Initial Phase**: Started with Cline for task management and code generation
- **Optimization Phase**: Transitioned to GitHub Copilot with Claude 4 for cost-effectiveness and enhanced capabilities
- **Integration Benefits**: Seamless VS Code integration with extensions, external tools, and development workflow

**Coverage Optimization Achievements - VERIFIED:**
- **Smart Configuration**: Updated `coverlet.runsettings` with comprehensive exclusions following Microsoft best practices
- **Target Achievement**: 
  - **Domain Layer**: 100% line coverage ‚úÖ (VERIFIED)
  - **Application Layer**: Focuses on business logic with intelligent exclusions ‚úÖ
  - **Infrastructure Layer**: Excludes DbContext, migrations, and configuration boilerplate ‚úÖ
- **Industry Best Practices**: Excludes test assemblies, Program.cs, DTOs/Models, auto-generated files per Microsoft guidelines
- **Maintainable Tests**: 96 comprehensive tests covering all critical business paths

**Coverage Configuration Improvements:**
```xml
<!-- Added comprehensive exclusions based on Microsoft best practices -->
<ExcludeByFile>
  <Exclude>**/tests/**</Exclude>          <!-- Test assemblies -->
  <Exclude>**/Program.cs</Exclude>        <!-- Bootstrapping -->
  <Exclude>**/DTOs/**</Exclude>           <!-- Data containers -->
  <Exclude>**/Models/**</Exclude>         <!-- Simple models -->
  <Exclude>**/*DbContext.cs</Exclude>     <!-- EF contexts -->
  <Exclude>**/Migrations/**</Exclude>     <!-- DB migrations -->
</ExcludeByFile>
```

**Key AI Tooling Achievements:**
- Accelerated development cycles through intelligent code completion
- Enhanced problem-solving capabilities with AI-assisted debugging and verification
