# Figma Project: UrbanAI UI/UX

This document outlines the structure and contents of the UrbanAI Figma project, which serves as the central source of truth for UI/UX design, wireframes, and the React component library.

## Project Structure

The Figma project is organized into the following main pages:

1.  **Wireframes:** Low-fidelity layouts for all major application screens and interaction flows.
2.  **Component Library:** Reusable UI components designed according to the project's style guide, intended to map directly to React components.
3.  **Style Guide:** Definition of typography, color palettes, spacing, iconography, and other visual design elements.
4.  **Prototypes:** Interactive flows demonstrating user journeys and key interactions.

## Wireframes

This page contains wireframes for the following key screens and flows:

-   **Issue Intake:**
    -   Landing page with option to report an issue.
    -   Form for submitting issue details (photo upload, description, location).
    -   Confirmation screen.
-   **Regulations Crawler:**
    -   Search interface for regulations by location or keywords.
    -   Display of search results.
    -   Detail view for a specific regulation.
-   **AI-Agent Chat:**
    -   Interface for interacting with the AI agent.
    -   Display of chat history.
    -   Input area for user queries.
-   **Report Generation:**
    -   Interface for reviewing collected data.
    -   Options for generating reports (PDF/docx).
    -   Case persistence and tracking view.

## Component Library

The Component Library page defines reusable UI components, including:

-   Buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary)
-   Input Fields (text, textarea, file upload)
-   Dropdowns and Selects
-   Checkboxes and Radio Buttons
-   Cards and Panels
-   Modals and Dialogs
-   Navigation Elements (headers, footers, sidebars)
-   Typography Styles
-   Color Swatches
-   Icons

Each component includes variations for different states (e.g., default, hover, active, disabled) and responsiveness considerations. The goal is to create a direct mapping between these Figma components and the React components implemented in the frontend.

## Style Guide

The Style Guide page documents the visual identity of the UrbanAI application, ensuring consistency across all designs. It includes:

-   **Typography:** Font families, sizes, weights, and line heights.
-   **Color Palette:** Primary, secondary, accent, and semantic colors (success, warning, error).
-   **Spacing:** Definition of a consistent spacing system.
-   **Iconography:** Set of icons used throughout the application.
-   **Imagery:** Guidelines for image usage.

## Prototypes

Interactive prototypes will be created to demonstrate key user flows, such as the issue reporting process and the AI agent interaction. These prototypes help visualize the user experience and validate design decisions before implementation.
