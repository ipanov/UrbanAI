# UrbanAI GDPR Compliance & Privacy Rights

## Your Privacy Rights Under EU GDPR

UrbanAI is committed to protecting your privacy and complying with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This page explains your rights and how we protect your personal data.

### üîí Our Privacy-First Approach

UrbanAI implements **maximum privacy protection** by design:
- **Zero Personal Data Storage**: We only store anonymous identifiers, never your name, email, or personal information
- **OAuth-Only Authentication**: Your identity stays with trusted providers (Microsoft, Google, Facebook)
- **Client-Side Personalization**: Your personal information is displayed locally in your browser but never transmitted to our servers
- **Anonymous Case Reporting**: Your issue reports are linked anonymously for municipal tracking

- ‚úÖ **Proportionality**: We process minimal data (no PII)
- ‚úÖ **Less Intrusive Means**: OAuth providers handle all personal data
- ‚úÖ **Your Rights**: You can object or withdraw at any time

### Consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR)
**Where We Seek Consent**:
- Optional marketing communications
- Non-essential analytics
- Enhanced notification features

**Your Control**:
