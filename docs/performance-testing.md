# Performance Testing Plan for Azure Functions Migration

  - Frequency: Measure cold start times for each function
  - Expected: < 5 seconds for .NET isolated functions
  - Metrics: Cold start duration, initialization time

### 4. Scalability Tests
- **Test Case 4.1**: Auto-scaling behavior
  - Load: Gradually increase from 100 to 1000 concurrent users
  - Duration: 10 minutes
  - Expected: Linear scaling, no performance degradation
  - Metrics: Scale-out events, instance count, response time consistency

## Test Environment

### Staging Environment
- Azure Functions App (Consumption Plan)
- SQL Database (Basic tier)
- Cosmos DB (Serverless)
- Same configuration as production but with test data

### Production Environment
- Azure Functions App (Consumption Plan)
- SQL Database (Basic tier)
- Cosmos DB (Serverless)
- Real production data (subset for testing)

## Testing Tools

### 1. Load Testing Framework
- **Apache JMeter** or **k6** for HTTP load testing
- **Azure Load Testing** service for cloud-based testing
- Custom scripts for each endpoint scenario

### 2. Monitoring and Metrics
- **Application Insights** for function execution monitoring
- **Azure Monitor** for infrastructure metrics
- **SQL Database Monitoring** for query performance
- **Cosmos DB Metrics** for database performance

## Performance Baselines

### Current API Performance (Baseline)
| Endpoint | Avg Response Time | 95th Percentile | Throughput (RPS) | Error Rate |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| GET /api/issues | 150ms | 400ms | 50 | < 0.1% |
| GET /api/issues/{id} | 80ms | 250ms | 100 | < 0.1% |
| POST /api/issues | 400ms | 800ms | 25 | < 0.1% |
| PUT /api/issues/{id} | 250ms | 600ms | 30 | < 0.1% |
| DELETE /api/issues/{id} | 150ms | 400ms | 40 | < 0.1% |
| POST /api/auth/exchange-token | 700ms | 1200ms | 35 | < 0.1% |
| POST /api/auth/register-external | 800ms | 1500ms | 30 | < 0.1% |

### Target Performance (Functions)
| Endpoint | Avg Response Time | 95th Percentile | Throughput (RPS) | Error Rate |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| GET /api/issues | < 200ms | < 500ms | ≥ 50 | < 0.1% |
| GET /api/issues/{id} | < 100ms | < 300ms | ≥ 100 | < 0.1% |
| POST /api/issues | < 500ms | < 1000ms | ≥ 25 | < 0.1% |
| PUT /api/issues/{id} | < 300ms | < 800ms | ≥ 30 | < 0.1% |
| DELETE /api/issues/{id} | < 200ms | < 600ms | ≥ 40 | < 0.1% |
| POST /api/auth/exchange-token | < 800ms | < 1500ms | ≥ 35 | < 0.1% |
| POST /api/auth/register-external | < 1000ms | < 2000ms | ≥ 30 | < 0.1% |

## Test Execution Schedule

## Success Criteria

### Performance Requirements
1. **Response Time**: All endpoints must meet target response times
2. **Throughput**: Functions must handle expected concurrent load
3. **Error Rate**: < 0.1% error rate under normal conditions
4. **Cold Start**: < 5 seconds for function initialization
5. **Scalability**: Linear scaling up to 1000 concurrent users

### Cost Requirements
1. **Consumption Plan**: Functions must execute within consumption limits
2. **Database Costs**: No significant increase in database operations
3. **Storage Costs**: Efficient use of storage accounts

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Function execution count and duration
- Cold start frequency and duration
- Database query performance
- External API call performance
- Error rates and failure patterns
- Memory and CPU utilization

### Alerting Thresholds
- Response time > 2x target threshold
- Error rate > 1%
- Cold start duration > 10 seconds
- Database query time > 5 seconds

## Rollback Plan

### Performance Degradation Response
1. **Immediate**: Route traffic back to original API
2. **Analysis**: Identify performance bottlenecks
3. **Optimization**: Apply fixes and retest
4. **Re-deployment**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
