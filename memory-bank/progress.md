# Progress – UrbanAI

## Status summary
- Memory Bank initialized with core files:
  - projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md
- Project-specific `.clinerules` created and aligned to Cline Memory Bank best practices.
- Documentation sources mapped: `docs/api/openapi.yaml`, diagrams, design system, personas.
- Solution structure verified: API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, Frontend scaffold present.
- Tests present across layers; CI pipeline defined (Azure Pipelines) with coverage artifacts.

## What works (repo evidence)
- API layer: `AuthController`, `IssuesController` wired to Application services.
- Application layer: DTOs and Services for Issues/Regulations/Users; explicit DTO↔Entity mapping.
- Domain layer: Entities (`Issue`, `Regulation`, `User`), repository interfaces, base entity.
- Infrastructure layer:
  - EF Core: `ApplicationDbContext`, configuration, migrations present.
  - Mongo: `MongoDbContext`, `MongoDbSettings`, `RegulationDocument`, repositories.
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold available.
- CI/CD: `azure-pipelines.yml` configured to build, test, and publish coverage.

## In progress (this session)
- Establish Memory Bank and align `.clinerules` with team conventions.
- Capture system patterns and tech context from codebase and docs.
- Prepare custom instructions for docs to mirror `.clinerules`.

## Next up
- Validate OpenAPI spec vs. implemented endpoints (Issues/Auth) and close any gaps.
- Extend integration tests for Mongo-backed regulation flows.
- Implement/verify regulation endpoints in API via `RegulationService` + repo.
- Frontend: connect basic issue create/read flows to API.
- Create a short Developer Onboarding guide referencing Memory Bank and run commands.

## Known gaps / risks
- Environment configuration specifics (connection strings per env) to be finalized.
- Auth provider specifics for non-test runs (stub vs. external identity).
- Potential duplication between `Application/Interfaces` and `Application/Features/*`.
- Production hardening items (CORS, HTTPS enforcement, logging/monitoring, secrets management).

## Decisions (tracking)
- Clean Architecture boundaries enforced.
- EF Core for relational data; MongoDB for regulation documents.
- REST-first; diagrams and OpenAPI are contract sources of truth.
- Keep AI Agent integration behind Application abstractions.
