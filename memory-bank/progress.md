# Progress Log – UrbanAI (Automated Remediation Session)

Date: 2025-08-17

Summary:
- Started triage for CI failure run 17024924660 (issue #2). Initial failure: missing `reportgenerator` command during coverage verification.
- Implemented a minimal, low-risk remediation to install ReportGenerator as a repo-local .NET tool and call the repo-local executable from the coverage script.
- While monitoring CI, a separate failure surfaced: frontend `npm ci` failing due to package-lock drift.
- Regenerated `src/UrbanAI.Frontend/package-lock.json` and committed it directly to `develop` per instructions to continue pushing fixes until CI stabilizes.

Actions taken (chronological):
1. Read memory-bank core files and .clinerules to follow required process.
2. Updated .github/workflows/deploy.yml:
   - Replaced global dotnet tool install with repo-local install:
     dotnet tool install --tool-path tools dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
   - Added repo-local tools path to PATH for the job.
3. Updated .github/scripts/check-coverage.ps1:
   - Call repo-local reportgenerator explicitly:
     $coverage = & .\tools\reportgenerator -reports:$coverageFile -reporttypes:TextSummary -targetdir:coverage-report
4. Created branch `fix/reportgenerator-tool`, committed changes, pushed branch.
5. Merged `fix/reportgenerator-tool` into `develop` (direct merge as requested).
6. Observed CI run on develop encountered frontend failure:
   - `npm ci` failed with EUSAGE: package.json and package-lock.json out of sync.
7. Locally ran `npm install` in `src/UrbanAI.Frontend` to regenerate `package-lock.json`.
8. Committed regenerated `src/UrbanAI.Frontend/package-lock.json` and pushed to `develop`.

Current CI status:
- Waiting for the develop CI run to complete to verify:
  - frontend-check (checks Node install + `npm ci` behavior) — triggered by the push to develop
  - build-test / deploy-staging (if relevant) — triggered per workflow conditions
- Timestamp of last action: 2025-08-17 21:40:15 (Europe/Skopje)

Status:
- [x] Remediation for missing ReportGenerator applied and pushed to develop.
- [x] package-lock regenerated and pushed to develop to fix `npm ci` lockfile drift.
- [ ] Awaiting CI runs to complete on develop to verify coverage and frontend checks.
- [ ] If CI still fails, collect artifacts (coverage-report, test-results, frontend-test-results) and iterate.

Recommended next steps (if CI fails after these changes):
1. If frontend still fails:
   - Download frontend-test-results artifact and the npm debug log from the runner (paste here).
   - Confirm Node and npm versions used by the runner match expected (Node 20, npm version).
   - If lockfile still incompatible, inspect package.json for dependency fields that may cause transient differences (e.g., use of `file:` or local packages), then pin versions or update lockfile accordingly.
   - As temporary measure, modify lightweight CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to use `npm install` instead of `npm ci` for develop branch until the repo lockfile strategy is stabilized.
2. If coverage step still fails (reportgenerator):
   - Download `coverage-report` artifact and `TestResults` and paste logs.
   - Confirm `tools/reportgenerator` exists in runner and is executable; otherwise adjust install step to ensure compatibility with Windows runners (deploy workflow uses windows-latest there).
3. Document final resolution in memory-bank/progress.md (this file).

Notes:
- Per project rules, I proceeded with direct commits to `develop` as you instructed (no PR).
- I will continue to monitor and iterate on failures — please indicate whether you want me to:
  - Poll GitHub Actions runs and report results here (requires GH API token or gh CLI; alternatively you can paste run logs/URLs), or
  - Wait for you to paste CI logs/artifacts if a run fails.

This progress file will be updated after the CI results are available and any further remediation steps are applied.
