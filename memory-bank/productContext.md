# Product Context â€“ UrbanAI

## Why this exists
Cities need a structured way to intake, triage, and resolve urban issues (e.g., potholes, lighting, waste) while referencing relevant regulations. UrbanAI centralizes issue reporting, links cases to regulations, and assists operators with an AI agent to accelerate resolution and reporting.

## Users and goals

  - Report issues with photo, description, location
  - Receive confirmation and track basic status
- Municipal operators
  - Review, update, and resolve issues
  - Search and reference regulations
  - Generate reports and persist case context
- Administrators
  - Configure integrations and data sources
  - Monitor system health and compliance

## Key workflows (from docs)
- Issue Intake (docs/figma_project.md)
  - Submit details (photo, description, location)
  - Confirmation and tracking
- Regulations Crawler / Search (docs/figma_project.md)
  - Search by location/keywords
