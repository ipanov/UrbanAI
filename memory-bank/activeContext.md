# UrbanAI Active Context

## Current Development Status

### Recent Work (Claude Code Session)
- ✅ **Frontend Routing**: Added comprehensive routing for landing page, login, dashboard, issues, and legal pages
- ✅ **Mobile App**: Created React Native screens for privacy policy and terms of service
- ✅ **Deployment Configuration**: Configured Azure Functions to serve frontend at /app path
- ✅ **UI Components**: Built landing page, legal pages with consistent styling
- ✅ **Authentication Flow**: Enhanced OAuth login with user type selection

### Current Architecture State
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript with Vite, deployed to Azure Functions /app path
- **Backend**: .NET 9 API with Clean Architecture pattern
- **Database**: Azure SQL + MongoDB configuration
- **Authentication**: Microsoft OAuth integration
- **Mobile**: React Native with Expo configuration

## Immediate Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Complete Frontend Deployment**
   - Fix TypeScript compilation errors
   - Test /app path routing in production
   - Validate mobile app builds

2. **Database Setup**
   - Complete Azure SQL migrations
   - Configure MongoDB connection
   - Seed initial data for testing

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests (80%+ coverage)
   - Set up integration tests for API endpoints
   - Configure E2E tests with Playwright

### Medium Priority
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Complete GitHub Actions workflow
   - Implement automated deployment
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

5. **Security Implementation**
   - Complete OAuth configuration
   - Implement proper authorization
   - Add security headers and validation

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Known Issues
- **TypeScript Errors**: Unused imports in legal pages causing build failures
- **Mobile Build**: Need to verify React Native configuration
- **Database Migrations**: EF Core migrations need completion
- **Environment Configuration**: Multiple .env files need consolidation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API layers
- **Frontend State**: React Context for user management
- **Styling**: CSS modules with design system approach
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E

## Current Session Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Complete Synchronization**: Successfully sync Claude Code and Cline workflows
2. **Establish Concurrent Development**: Enable seamless switching between tools
3. **Document Current State**: Update memory bank with latest progress
4. **Create Development Scripts**: Automate tool switching and configuration

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Both Claude Code and Cline can work concurrently without conflicts
- ✅ Memory bank accurately reflects current project state
- ✅ Development workflow is documented and reproducible
- ✅ Configuration files are synchronized and version controlled

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Context Window Limits**: Large codebase may exceed AI context limits
- **Configuration Conflicts**: Different tool configurations may conflict
- **Version Control**: Complex branching strategy for concurrent development

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Modular Documentation**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, focused sessions
- **Configuration Management**: Use environment-specific configuration files
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for tool-specific work, main for integration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish creating all core documentation files
2. **Create Switching Scripts**: Automate stash/pop operations for tool switching
3. **Test Concurrent Workflow**: Verify both tools can work without conflicts
4. **Update Progress Tracking**: Document current implementation status

### Future Considerations
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize AI tool performance
- **Workflow Automation**: Create scripts for common development tasks
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document best practices for concurrent development
- **Scalability Planning**: Plan for larger team collaboration scenarios

## Communication & Collaboration

### Team Coordination
- **Documentation Standards**: Maintain consistent documentation across tools
- **Code Review Process**: Ensure both tools follow same quality standards
- **Progress Tracking**: Regular updates to memory bank and progress files

### Tool Integration
- **Configuration Sync**: Automated synchronization of settings between tools
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Seamless context sharing between Claude and Cline sessions
- **Quality Assurance**: Consistent testing and validation across both workflows
