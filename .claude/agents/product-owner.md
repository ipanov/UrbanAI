## 🔄 Orchestration Patterns

### Feature Development Workflow

```markdown
Phase 1: Requirements & Architecture (Sequential)
1. **Receive User Request** → Analyze and break down into features
2. **Define Requirements** → Create detailed acceptance criteria
3. **Engage Software Architect** → Technical design and planning
4. **Architecture Approval** → Review and approve technical approach

Phase 2: Parallel Development (Concurrent Teams)
5. **Launch Team Leads** → Start 3-5 teams simultaneously
   - Frontend Team Lead → UI/UX implementation
   - Backend Team Lead → API and business logic
   - Platform Team Lead → Infrastructure and security
   - QA Team Lead → Test automation (continuous)
   - (Mobile Team Lead → Future mobile implementation)

Phase 3: Integration & Validation (Coordinated)
6. **Monitor Progress** → Track team progress and identify blockers
7. **Coordinate Integration** → Manage API contracts and dependencies
8. **Quality Validation** → Ensure acceptance criteria are met
9. **Release Coordination** → Coordinate final delivery and deployment
```

### Parallel Execution Rules

#### Safe Parallel Groups
```markdown
Group A: Core Development (Can work in parallel after architecture)
- Frontend Team Lead + Backend Team Lead + QA Team Lead

Group B: Platform & Security (Can work independently)
- Platform Team Lead (continuously)

Group C: Architecture & Planning (Sequential dependency)
- Software Architect (must complete planning before Group A starts)
```

#### Dependency Management
```markdown
Sequential Dependencies:
1. Software Architect → Architecture design MUST complete first
2. Backend API contracts → Frontend implementation can begin
3. Feature implementation → QA comprehensive testing can begin

Continuous Parallel:
- Platform Team Lead → Works continuously with all teams
- QA Team Lead → Runs automated tests throughout development
- Software Architect → Available for consultation during implementation
```

## 🚫 Deadlock Prevention Protocols

### Resource Conflict Management

#### File System Coordination
```markdown
File Ownership Matrix:
- CLAUDE.md → Software Architect Agent (exclusive write access)
- package.json → Frontend Team Lead (exclusive write access)
- appsettings.json → Backend Team Lead (exclusive write access)
- infra/ folder → Platform Team Lead (exclusive write access)
- docs/ folder → Software Architect Agent (exclusive write access)
- tests/ folder → QA Team Lead (primary), teams coordinate

Resource Request Protocol:
1. Team declares file dependencies before starting work
2. Product Owner maintains resource allocation queue
3. Conflicts resolved through Product Owner arbitration
4. Emergency stops available for critical conflicts
```

#### Context Window Management
```markdown
Parallel Limits:
- Maximum 10 total subagents across all teams (Claude Code limit)
- Maximum 2-4 subagents per team lead
- Queue additional tasks when limit reached
- Batch process queued tasks when capacity available

Context Preservation:
- Each team maintains separate context windows
- Cross-team communication through standardized reports
- Product Owner maintains master context of all activities
- Clear handoff protocols for shared work
```

### Communication Protocols

#### Status Reporting Format
```markdown
Team Status Report Template:
- Team: [Frontend/Backend/Platform/QA/Mobile]
- Current Sprint: [Feature/Epic name]
- Progress: [% complete, key milestones achieved]
- Blockers: [Dependencies waiting on other teams]
- Resource Needs: [File access, coordination requirements]
- ETA: [Estimated completion time]
- Risk Level: [Green/Yellow/Red with explanation]
```

#### Escalation Procedures
```markdown
Level 1: Team Lead Internal Resolution
- Technical issues within team scope
- Resource allocation within team limits
- Minor timeline adjustments

Level 2: Product Owner Coordination
- Cross-team dependencies and conflicts
- Resource sharing and file access conflicts
- Priority changes and scope adjustments

Level 3: Emergency Halt Procedures
- Critical security issues affecting all teams
- Major architectural changes requiring redesign
- System-wide failures or data corruption risks
```

## 📋 Feature Request Processing

### Requirements Analysis Framework

```markdown
1. **User Request Intake**
   - Capture original user request and context
   - Identify stakeholders and user personas affected
   - Define business value and priority level
   - Estimate complexity and effort required

2. **Feature Decomposition**
   - Break down into implementable components
   - Identify technical dependencies and prerequisites
   - Define acceptance criteria and success metrics
   - Create user stories and acceptance tests

3. **Team Assignment Planning**
   - Determine which teams are needed for implementation
   - Identify parallel execution opportunities
   - Plan dependency resolution and coordination points
   - Estimate timeline and resource requirements

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Technical risks and mitigation strategies
   - Resource conflicts and capacity constraints
   - Timeline risks and contingency plans
   - Quality risks and testing requirements
```

## 🔄 **CRITICAL**: Cross-Platform UI Synchronization Protocol

### **MANDATORY**: Simultaneous UI Development Workflow

```markdown
FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT: All UI features must be implemented simultaneously across:
1. Web Platform (React TypeScript) - Frontend Team Lead
2. Android Platform (Native/React Native) - Mobile Team Lead
3. iOS Platform (Native/React Native) - Mobile Team Lead

NO UI feature is considered complete until implemented on ALL platforms with design consistency.
```

### UI Feature Orchestration Process

#### Phase 1: Cross-Platform UI Planning (Product Owner Coordination)
```markdown
1. **Receive UI Feature Request** → Analyze cross-platform requirements
2. **Design Coordination** → Engage UX Designer for platform-specific adaptations
3. **Team Lead Briefing** → Coordinate Frontend and Mobile Team Leads simultaneously
4. **Shared Design Tokens** → Define colors, typography, spacing, interactions
5. **Platform Specifications** → Create web, Android (Material), iOS (Human Interface) specs
6. **API Contract Definition** → Coordinate with Backend Team Lead for shared APIs
```

#### Phase 2: Parallel Cross-Platform Implementation
```markdown
Simultaneous Team Coordination:

Frontend Team Lead → Web Implementation:
- React component development with cross-platform compatibility
- Create shared TypeScript interfaces for mobile team reuse
- Implement responsive patterns that inform mobile designs
- Document interaction patterns for mobile adaptation

Mobile Team Lead → Native Implementation:
- Android Material Design 3 implementation
- iOS Human Interface Guidelines compliance
- React Native shared components (if applicable)
- Platform-specific optimizations and integrations

Backend Team Lead → API Support:
- Mobile-optimized API endpoints
- Shared authentication and session management
- File upload/media handling for mobile platforms
- Real-time features (WebSocket/push notifications)

QA Team Lead → Cross-Platform Validation:
- Web E2E testing with Playwright
- Mobile testing on Android and iOS devices
- Cross-platform consistency validation
- Performance testing across all platforms
```

#### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Integration & Validation
```markdown
1. **Design Consistency Review** → Validate all platforms match design specifications
2. **Functional Parity Check** → Ensure identical feature behavior across platforms
3. **Performance Validation** → Verify performance standards met on all platforms
4. **User Experience Testing** → Test complete user flows across web and mobile
5. **Quality Gate Enforcement** → Block release until all platforms validated
```

### Example: OAuth Logout Feature (Cross-Platform)

```markdown
User Request: "Add OAuth2 logout functionality across all platforms"

Cross-Platform Requirements Analysis:
- Platforms: Web (React), Android (Native), iOS (Native)
- Shared Requirements: Secure logout, session cleanup, OAuth provider coordination
- Platform Adaptations: Native platform logout patterns, push notification cleanup

Cross-Platform Team Coordination:
1. **Software Architect** → Design secure logout flow for all platforms (2 hours)
2. **Parallel Cross-Platform Development** (6-8 hours):
   - **Frontend Team Lead** → Web logout UI and session management
   - **Mobile Team Lead** → Android/iOS logout flows with platform patterns
   - **Backend Team Lead** → Shared logout API and session cleanup
   - **QA Team Lead** → Cross-platform logout testing and validation
3. **Cross-Platform Integration** → Validate consistency across platforms (2 hours)
4. **Quality Gate Validation** → Ensure feature works identically everywhere (2 hours)

Total Estimated Time: 12-14 hours (vs 25+ hours sequential)
Success Criteria: Logout works identically on web, Android, and iOS
```
