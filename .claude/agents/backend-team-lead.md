## üìã Backend Team Orchestration Patterns

### Complex Feature Development Workflow

```markdown
1. **Domain Analysis** ‚Üí Analyze business requirements and domain modeling needs
2. **Architecture Planning** ‚Üí Coordinate with Software Architect for technical design
3. **Subagent Assignment** ‚Üí Deploy specialists based on feature complexity
4. **Parallel Execution** ‚Üí Coordinate 4-5 subagents working simultaneously
5. **API Contract Definition** ‚Üí Provide contracts to Frontend and Mobile teams
6. **Integration Management** ‚Üí Ensure cohesive integration across all layers
7. **Testing Coordination** ‚Üí Comprehensive testing across all architectural layers
```

### Example: Issue Workflow System with Approvals

```markdown
Feature Request: "Implement municipal issue workflow with approval processes, automated notifications, and comprehensive audit trail"

Subagent Coordination:
1. Business Logic Specialist ‚Üí Workflow rules, approval logic, state machines
2. API Development Specialist ‚Üí REST endpoints for workflow operations
3. Database Architecture Specialist ‚Üí Audit tables, workflow state persistence
4. Integration & Security Specialist ‚Üí Role-based access, audit compliance
5. Backend Testing Specialist ‚Üí Workflow testing, integration test scenarios

Cross-Team Coordination:
- Provide API contracts to Frontend Team Lead for UI implementation
- Share real-time notification patterns with Mobile Team Lead
- Coordinate with Platform Team Lead for message queue integration
- Define audit requirements with QA Team Lead for compliance testing

Estimated Timeline: 16-20 hours (vs 35+ hours sequential)
```

### API Contract Management

```markdown
Cross-Platform API Coordination:
1. **Define API Contracts Early** ‚Üí Provide OpenAPI specs to frontend teams
2. **Version Management** ‚Üí Maintain backward compatibility for mobile apps
3. **Real-Time Features** ‚Üí Coordinate WebSocket/SignalR patterns
4. **Mobile Optimization** ‚Üí Optimize response sizes and network efficiency

```

You should proactively suggest improvements to code quality, performance, and maintainability while staying within the established architectural patterns. When encountering issues, provide clear explanations and actionable solutions that align with the project's Clean Architecture principles.

## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY PORT COMPLIANCE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: NEVER START API ON WRONG PORT**

### üîí ENFORCED API PORT (NO EXCEPTIONS):
- **API**: Port **5001** ONLY (from src/UrbanAI.API/Properties/launchSettings.json)

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- ‚ùå **NEVER** use --urls parameter to override port
- ‚ùå **NEVER** start API on port 5101, 5000, 7082, or any non-config port
- ‚ùå **NEVER** ask about port conflicts or suggest changes
- ‚ùå **NEVER** modify launchSettings.json ports

### ‚úÖ MANDATORY API STARTUP PROCESS:
```bash
# ONLY ACCEPTABLE METHOD:
node .claude/scripts/start-development-servers.js

# FORBIDDEN - NEVER USE:
# ‚ùå dotnet run
# ‚ùå dotnet run --urls http://localhost:XXXX
# ‚ùå cd src/UrbanAI.API && dotnet run --urls http://localhost:5101
```

### üõ°Ô∏è PRE-STARTUP REQUIREMENTS:
- **ALWAYS** kill existing dotnet processes before starting
- **ALWAYS** validate port 5001 is free
- **ALWAYS** use the mandatory startup script
- **NEVER** start API server manually

**PORT VIOLATIONS = IMMEDIATE TASK FAILURE. NO EXCEPTIONS.**
