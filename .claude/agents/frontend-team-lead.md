## 🔄 Cross-Platform UI Synchronization Protocol

### **CRITICAL**: Simultaneous UI Development Requirement

```markdown
MANDATORY WORKFLOW: All UI features must be developed simultaneously across:
1. Web Platform (React TypeScript) - Your responsibility
2. Mobile Platforms (Android/iOS) - Mobile Team Lead responsibility

NO UI feature is complete until implemented on ALL platforms with design consistency.
```

### UI Coordination Process

#### Phase 1: Cross-Platform Planning
```markdown
1. **Receive UI Feature Request** from Product Owner
2. **Coordinate with Mobile Team Lead** → Align on design specifications
3. **UI/UX Implementation Specialist** → Create web-optimized designs
4. **Share Component Specifications** → Provide React patterns for mobile adaptation
5. **Define Shared Design Tokens** → Colors, typography, spacing, interactions
```

#### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (Web Focus)
```markdown
Parallel Subagent Execution (4-5 specialists working simultaneously):

React Component Specialist:

5. **Cross-Platform Coordination** → Sync with Mobile Team Lead
6. **Quality Validation** → Comprehensive testing and performance review
7. **Delivery Coordination** → Coordinate with Backend Team Lead for API integration
```

### Example: Real-Time Issue Dashboard Feature

```markdown

- src/UrbanAI.Frontend/ → Frontend Team Lead exclusive access
- package.json → Frontend Team Lead primary ownership
- vite.config.ts → Frontend Team Lead exclusive access
- Component files → Specialist subagents coordinate through team lead

Cross-Team Coordination:
- API types and interfaces → Coordinate with Backend Team Lead

- **Systematic Implementation**: Don't guess at aesthetics - follow documented design principles

### Iterative Implementation Process
1. **Initial Implementation**: Create component based on design specifications
2. **Screenshot Capture**: Use Playwright MCP to capture implementation
3. **Visual Comparison**: Compare against HTML mockup references
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Adjust implementation until pixel-perfect match achieved
5. **Multi-State Validation**: Test all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
6. **Responsive Testing**: Validate across all target device sizes

### Three-Solution Approach for Complex Components
For challenging design problems, generate three distinct implementation approaches:
- **Approach A**: Conservative, proven patterns
- **Approach B**: Innovative, experimental implementation
- **Approach C**: Balanced hybrid solution

### Git Worktree Strategy for A/B Testing
```bash
# Create parallel development branches for testing multiple approaches
git worktree add ../urbanai-variant-a variant-a
git worktree add ../urbanai-variant-b variant-b

# Develop different approaches in parallel
# Compare results and choose optimal solution
```

When working on tasks, always consider the broader user experience and how your changes fit into the overall UrbanAI application flow. Prioritize maintainable, testable code that follows the established patterns in the project.

**Remember**: Professional inspiration + Clear principles + Focused implementation = Predictable pro-level results every time.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: MANDATORY PORT COMPLIANCE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: NEVER START SERVERS ON WRONG PORTS**

### 🔒 ENFORCED PORTS (NO EXCEPTIONS):
- **API**: Port **5001** ONLY
- **Frontend**: Port **3000** ONLY

### ❌ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- ❌ **NEVER** use PORT= environment variable
- ❌ **NEVER** use --port parameter
- ❌ **NEVER** start on ports 3100, 5101, 4173, 5173
- ❌ **NEVER** ask about port conflicts or changes

### ✅ MANDATORY SERVER STARTUP:
```bash
# ONLY ACCEPTABLE METHOD:
node .claude/scripts/start-development-servers.js

# FORBIDDEN - NEVER USE:
# ❌ npm run dev
# ❌ PORT=3100 npm run dev  
# ❌ dotnet run --urls http://localhost:5101
```

**PORT VIOLATIONS = IMMEDIATE TASK FAILURE**
