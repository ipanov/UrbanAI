- **API Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Implement proper logging and monitoring for production APIs

## ðŸ”§ Backend API Capabilities

### Essential Technologies & Patterns
```markdown
**Clean Architecture Layers**:
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic, entities, value objects, domain interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, DTOs, application services, business workflows
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access, external services, framework implementations
- **API Layer**: Controllers, middleware, HTTP concerns, OAuth integration

**ASP.NET Core 9 Features**:
- Minimal APIs for simplified endpoint definitions
- Native AOT compilation for performance optimization
- Improved dependency injection and service lifetime management
- Enhanced logging and telemetry capabilities
- Built-in OpenAPI documentation generation

**Data Access Patterns**:
- Entity Framework Core with Azure SQL Database
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
- Database migrations and schema management
- Caching strategies for performance optimization
```

### API Design Standards
```markdown
**RESTful API Principles**:
- Resource-based URL design with proper HTTP methods
- Consistent response formats with proper status codes
- HATEOAS principles for API discoverability
- Versioning strategies for API evolution
- Proper content negotiation and media types

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- OAuth2 with JWT tokens for API security
- Role-based access control for municipal operators
- API key authentication for service-to-service communication
- Rate limiting and throttling for abuse prevention
- CORS configuration for web and mobile clients

**Error Handling & Validation**:
- Global exception handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Request validation with fluent validation patterns
- Detailed error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- Audit logging for security and compliance tracking
- Graceful degradation for service unavailability
```

## ðŸ“‹ API Implementation Deliverables

### Clean Architecture Implementation
```markdown
**Domain Layer Components**:
- Urban issue entities with proper business rules
- Value objects for addresses, statuses, priorities
- Domain events for issue lifecycle management
- Domain services for complex business calculations
- Aggregates and aggregate roots for consistency boundaries

**Application Layer Services**:
- Use cases for issue CRUD operations
- Command and query separation (CQRS) patterns
- Application services for orchestrating business workflows
- DTO mappers for domain-to-API transformation
- Application events for cross-cutting concerns

**Infrastructure Layer Implementations**:
- Entity Framework Core repositories and DbContext
- External service integrations (OAuth, notifications, storage)
- Caching implementations with Redis or in-memory providers
- Logging and monitoring integrations
- Background services for async processing

**API Layer Controllers**:
- Thin controllers following RESTful principles
- Proper input validation and model binding
- OAuth2 authorization with policy-based access control
- Response formatting with consistent API contracts
- OpenAPI documentation with detailed schemas
```

### Security & Compliance Implementation
```markdown
**OAuth2 Integration**:
- Microsoft Identity Platform integration
- Google OAuth2 provider implementation
- JWT token validation and refresh strategies
- Token revocation and session management
- Cross-token validation between web and mobile

**Data Protection**:
- Entity Framework Core data encryption
- Sensitive data masking in API responses
- Audit trail implementation for all data modifications
- Data retention and deletion automation
- Secure configuration management with Azure Key Vault

**Compliance Features**:
- GDPR compliance through data minimization
- Audit logging for all user actions
- Data subject request processing workflows
- Consent management for citizen data
- Regular compliance reporting and validation
```
