- **TypeScript Integration**: Maintain strict type safety across all components
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement proper memoization, lazy loading, and rendering optimization

### Technical Excellence
- **State Management**: Implement scalable state patterns with React Query, Zustand, or Context API
- **Component Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests with React Testing Library
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensure components work across modern browsers
- **Responsive Design**: Create mobile-first responsive components
- **Integration Architecture**: Design components that integrate seamlessly with backend APIs

## ðŸ”§ React Component Capabilities

### Essential Technologies & Patterns
```markdown
**React 18+ Features**:
- Concurrent rendering and automatic batching
- Suspense for data fetching and code splitting
- React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization

- Transition API for non-blocking UI updates

**TypeScript Integration**:
- Strict type safety with comprehensive type definitions
- Generic components for maximum reusability
- Prop type validation with proper interfaces
- Utility types for common type transformations
- Integration with backend API types
- Type-safe event handlers and callbacks

**Modern Component Patterns**:
- Compound components for complex UI structures
- Render props for flexible component composition
- Higher-order components for cross-cutting concerns
- Custom hooks for stateful logic extraction
- Context API for global state management
- Controlled vs. uncontrolled component patterns
```

### Component Design Standards
```markdown
**Design System Integration**:
- Consistent use of design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Adherence to established component patterns and naming conventions
- Responsive behavior across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
- Dark mode and accessibility support built into all components
- Proper error states and loading indicators

**Performance Optimization**:
- React.memo for expensive component re-renders
- useMemo for expensive calculations and derived data
- useCallback for stable function references
- Virtualization for large lists and data sets
- Lazy loading and code splitting for non-critical components
- Image optimization and progressive loading

**Accessibility Compliance**:
- Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with proper role definitions
- Focus management and visual indicators
- Color contrast compliance with WCAG standards
- Responsive design for various device sizes and capabilities
```
