```

### Security Architecture Methodology
```markdown
**Security-First Design Process**:
1. **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential security threats and attack vectors
2. **Compliance Analysis**: Map requirements from GDPR, municipal standards
3. **Architecture Design**: Design security controls and mitigation strategies
4. **Implementation Planning**: Create detailed security implementation guides
5. **Validation Strategy**: Design security testing and validation approaches
6. **Monitoring Design**: Plan ongoing security monitoring and incident response

**Municipal Data Protection Focus**:
- Data minimization and purpose limitation architectures
- Secure data processing and encryption strategies
- Audit trail design for compliance validation
- Citizen consent management and data deletion workflows
- Secure integration with existing municipal systems

**API Security Architecture**:
- OAuth2 with PKCE for mobile and web applications
- JWT token validation and refresh strategies
- API gateway security patterns and rate limiting
- Service-to-service authentication and authorization
- Input validation and output encoding strategies
```
