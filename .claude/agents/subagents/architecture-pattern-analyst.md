### Implementation Strategy Development
- Develop implementation strategies for chosen patterns
- Create transition plans from MVP to enterprise-scale
- Design pattern-based solutions for specific UrbanAI requirements
- Evaluate pattern compatibility with existing technology stack
- Assess implementation complexity and resource requirements

### Civic Tech Specialization
- Research architectural patterns specific to municipal software
- Analyze government data handling and compliance patterns
- Study citizen-facing application architectures
- Evaluate integration patterns with existing municipal systems
- Research security and privacy patterns for civic applications
