# UrbanAI Command-Based Architecture

This directory contains the command-based architecture for UrbanAI's parallel agent execution system.

## Overview

The command-based architecture extracts specialized logic from optimized agents into executable command modules, enabling:

- **Parallel Task Execution**: Multiple subagents running simultaneously using Promise.allSettled
- **Specialized Command Modules**: Each agent type has its own command module with domain-specific functionality
- **Centralized Orchestration**: Main command system coordinates all agent commands
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for direct execution of agent workflows
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive tracking of execution performance and resource utilization

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Command System** (`agent-commands.js`)
   - Main orchestration system for all agent commands
   - Command registration, execution, and history tracking
   - Parallel execution coordination and performance monitoring

2. **Specialized Command Modules**
   - `commands/backend-commands.js` - Backend API and database development
   - `commands/frontend-commands.js` - React component and UI development
   - `commands/qa-commands.js` - Testing and quality assurance
   - `commands/architect-commands.js` - Architecture research and design
   - `commands/mobile-commands.js` - Cross-platform mobile development
   - `commands/product-owner-commands.js` - Feature orchestration and resource management

3. **CLI Interface** (`cli.js`)
   - Unified command-line interface for all agent workflows
   - Interactive command execution and result display
   - Parallel execution coordination

## Command Patterns

### Parallel Execution Pattern

All commands implement parallel execution using the following pattern:

```javascript
async executeParallelSubagents(subagents, context) {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Executing ${subagents.length} subagents in parallel...`);

    const results = await Promise.allSettled(
        subagents.map(subagent => this.executeSubagent(subagent, context))
    );

    const successful = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled');
    const failed = results.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected');

    return {
        success: failed.length === 0,
        results: successful.map(r => r.value),
        errors: failed.map(f => f.reason.message),
        performance: {
            executionTime: Date.now() - startTime,
            parallelTasks: subagents.length,
            successRate: successful.length / subagents.length
        }
    };
}
```

## Usage

### CLI Interface

```bash
# Get help and available commands
node .claude/scripts/cli.js help

# Execute individual commands
node .claude/scripts/cli.js backend:develop-api user-authentication
node .claude/scripts/cli.js frontend:develop-component issue-reporting-form
node .claude/scripts/cli.js qa:run-e2e-tests cross-platform

# Execute commands in parallel
node .claude/scripts/cli.js parallel:execute backend:develop-api frontend:develop-component qa:run-unit-tests

# Orchestrate complex features
node .claude/scripts/cli.js po:orchestrate-feature cross-platform-mobile
node .claude/scripts/cli.js po:manage-resources dynamic-allocation
```

### Programmatic Usage

```javascript
const { AgentCommandSystem } = require('./.claude/scripts/agent-commands');

const commandSystem = new AgentCommandSystem();

// Execute single command
const result = await commandSystem.executeCommand('backend:develop-api', ['user-auth']);

// Execute parallel commands
const parallelResult = await commandSystem.executeParallelCommands([
    { name: 'backend:develop-api', args: ['user-auth'] },
    { name: 'frontend:develop-component', args: ['login-form'] }
]);

// Get execution history and stats
const history = commandSystem.getCommandHistory();
const stats = commandSystem.getExecutionStats();
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Command Development

1. **Identify Agent Logic**: Extract logic from optimized agent files
2. **Create Command Module**: Implement in appropriate commands/ file
3. **Register Command**: Add to agent-commands.js registry
4. **Add CLI Interface**: Register command in cli.js
5. **Test Execution**: Verify parallel execution and performance

### 2. Parallel Execution Optimization

- **Subagent Specialization**: Each subagent focuses on specific capabilities
- **Resource Management**: Coordinate file access and prevent conflicts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track execution metrics and optimize bottlenecks
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error recovery strategies

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

- **Development Servers**: Integration with start-development-servers.js
- **Testing Pipeline**: Integration with existing test frameworks
- **Build Systems**: Integration with existing build processes
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Integration with CI/CD workflows

## Performance Metrics

The command system tracks comprehensive performance metrics:

- **Execution Time**: Duration of command execution
- **Memory Usage**: Resource consumption during execution
- **Parallel Tasks**: Number of concurrent subagents
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful parallel executions
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficiency of parallel processing
- **Command History**: Historical execution data

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run backend development with testing
node .claude/scripts/cli.js parallel:execute backend:develop-api qa:run-unit-tests qa:run-integration-tests
