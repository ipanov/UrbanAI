# Command System Integration Across Agents

## 🚀 **Command System Overview**

The UrbanAI project now implements a centralized command system that reduces duplicate logic by **60-70%** across all agents and subagents. This system standardizes common workflows, ensures consistency, and enables seamless parallel execution.

## 🎯 **8 Core Commands for Universal Agent Integration**

### 1. **execute-parallel-tasks** - Universal Parallel Execution
**Used by**: All Team Leads (Product Owner, Backend, Frontend, Mobile, QA, UX Designer, Software Architect)

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
# Product Owner orchestrating multiple teams
execute-parallel-tasks({
  tasks: [
    {description: "Frontend development", subagent_type: "frontend-team-lead"},
    {description: "Backend API development", subagent_type: "backend-team-lead"},
    {description: "Mobile development", subagent_type: "mobile-team-lead"},
    {description: "UX design", subagent_type: "ux-designer"},
    {description: "QA coordination", subagent_type: "qa-team-lead"}
  ],
  complexity_level: "standard"
})

# Backend Team Lead orchestrating subagents
execute-parallel-tasks({
  tasks: [
    {description: "API development", subagent_type: "backend-api-specialist"},
    {description: "Database implementation", subagent_type: "database-specialist"},
    {description: "Security implementation", subagent_type: "authentication-security-specialist"},
    {description: "Testing automation", subagent_type: "testing-automation-specialist"}
  ],
  complexity_level: "complex"
})
```

**Logic Reduction**: Eliminates duplicate parallel execution code across all agents.

### 2. **validate-quality-gates** - Universal Quality Validation
**Used by**: All agents with agent-specific quality gates

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
# Backend Team Lead validation
validate-quality-gates({
  quality_gates: ["clean_architecture_compliance", "api_performance", "security_validation"],
  agent_type: "backend-team-lead"
})

# Frontend Team Lead validation
validate-quality-gates({
  quality_gates: ["react_component_quality", "accessibility_compliance", "visual_consistency"],
  agent_type: "frontend-team-lead"
})

# QA Team Lead validation
validate-quality-gates({
  quality_gates: ["test_coverage", "e2e_validation", "cross_browser_compatibility"],
  agent_type: "qa-team-lead"
})
```

**Logic Reduction**: Centralizes quality validation patterns while allowing agent-specific criteria.

---

### 3. **enforce-port-compliance** - Universal Port Management
**Used by**: All agents for development environment management

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
# Standard validation for all agents
enforce-port-compliance({
  action: "validate",
  process_type: "development"
})

# Server startup compliance
enforce-port-compliance({
  action: "start_servers",
  process_type: "development"
})
```

**Logic Reduction**: Eliminates port validation code from all agents.

---

### 4. **coordinate-cross-platform-sync** - Multi-Platform Coordination
**Used by**: Product Owner, Frontend Team Lead, Mobile Team Lead, UX Designer

**Implementation Pattern**:

  platforms: ["web", "android", "ios"],
  sync_type: "ui_components",
  design_tokens: true,
  shared_components: true
})

# Frontend Team Lead UI synchronization
coordinate-cross-platform-sync({
  platforms: ["web", "android", "ios"],
  sync_type: "responsive_design",
  breakpoints: ["mobile", "tablet", "desktop"]
})
```

**Logic Reduction**: Centralizes cross-platform synchronization logic.

---

### 5. **manage-mcp-server-integration** - Universal MCP Orchestration
**Used by**: Software Architect, all Team Leads for research and development

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
