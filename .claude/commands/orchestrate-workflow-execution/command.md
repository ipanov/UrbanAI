```

## Workflow Coordination Patterns

### Parallel Execution Pattern
```markdown
**PARALLEL WORKFLOW EXECUTION**:
Task({description: "Backend API development", subagent_type: "backend-team-lead"})
Task({description: "Frontend UI development", subagent_type: "frontend-team-lead"})
Task({description: "Mobile app development", subagent_type: "mobile-team-lead"})
Task({description: "Test suite development", subagent_type: "qa-team-lead"})
Task({description: "UX design validation", subagent_type: "ux-designer"})

**COORDINATION FOCUS**:
- Simultaneous development across all platforms
- Real-time communication and synchronization
- Shared quality gates and validation criteria
- Integrated testing and validation processes
```

### Sequential Stage Pattern
```markdown
**SEQUENTIAL STAGE EXECUTION**:
1. **Planning Stage**: Complexity assessment, resource planning, timeline development
2. **Development Stage**: Parallel development across platforms
3. **Testing Stage**: Comprehensive testing and validation
4. **Deployment Stage**: Deployment execution and monitoring

**QUALITY GATES BETWEEN STAGES**:
- Each stage must pass quality gates before proceeding
- Blocking issues must be resolved before advancement
- Stakeholder approval required for stage transitions
```

### Hybrid Execution Pattern
```markdown
**HYBRID PARALLEL-SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION**:
1. **Parallel Planning**: Multiple teams work on planning simultaneously
2. **Sequential Development**: Development occurs in coordinated phases
3. **Parallel Testing**: Multiple testing streams execute simultaneously
4. **Sequential Deployment**: Deployment occurs in controlled phases
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### With Execute Parallel Tasks
```javascript
// Workflow uses parallel tasks for development stages
const parallelTasks = generateParallelTasks(workflow.stages.development);
const taskResult = await executeParallelTasks(parallelTasks);
```

### With Quality Gates
```javascript
// Each stage validates quality gates
const qualityResult = await validateQualityGates({
  quality_gates: currentStage.quality_gates,
  agent_type: workflow.primary_agent,
  strict_mode: true
});
```

### With Cross-Platform Sync
```javascript
// Coordinate platform consistency
const syncResult = await coordinateCrossPlatformSync({
  platforms: workflow.platforms,
  sync_type: "complete_feature",
  feature_name: workflow.feature_name
});
```

## Workflow Monitoring and Management

### Progress Tracking
```javascript
{
  workflow_status: "in_progress",
  current_stage: "development",
  progress_percentage: 65,
  estimated_completion: "2024-01-16T18:00:00Z",
  active_agents: ["backend-team-lead", "frontend-team-lead"],
  blockers: [],
  risks: ["Timeline risk due to complex integration"]
}
```

### Performance Metrics
```javascript
{
  execution_efficiency: 0.85,
  resource_utilization: 0.78,
  quality_compliance: 0.94,
  timeline_accuracy: 0.82,
  stakeholder_satisfaction: 0.91
}
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Workflow Issues
1. **Stage Blockers**: Critical issues preventing stage completion
2. **Resource Constraints**: Team availability or skill gaps
3. **Timeline Delays**: Unforeseen delays in execution
4. **Quality Failures**: Quality gate validation failures
5. **Integration Issues**: Cross-team or cross-platform integration problems

### Recovery Strategies
```javascript
// Stage-specific recovery
if (stage.status === "blocked") {
  const recoveryResult = await manageCrossTeamCommunication({
    communication_type: "blocking_issue",
    from_team: workflow.coordinator,
    to_teams: stage.responsible_teams,
    message: stage.blocker_details,
    priority: "critical"
  });
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Workflow Definition**: Define workflows with clear stages and outcomes
2. **Realistic Planning**: Set realistic timelines and resource expectations
3. **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Strict quality validation between stages
4. **Effective Communication**: Maintain clear communication channels between teams
5. **Risk Management**: Proactively identify and mitigate risks
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor workflow progress and address issues promptly
7. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive workflow documentation
